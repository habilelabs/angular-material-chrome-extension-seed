# Angular(ng) Material Chrome Extension Seed

I am using angular cli as start. I clubbed it with  angular (angular 2 formally known as angular) material (https://material.angular.io/) 

## Why we created this seed

This is a quick start seed project for angular chrome extension using angular material UI. 
This project demonstrate sample project structure, router and modular structure. 

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|module`.

## Build

Run `npm run build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `demo-ext/` directory. Use the `-prod` flag for a production build.

## Run extension in Browser

To install your extension into a Chrome browser, open Browser and navigate to the extension manager.
 
At the top, enable developer extension and navigate to your project unpacked extension directory (demo-ext for this case). Loading it should place the extension in your Chrome toolbar like any other extension.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/).
Before running the tests make sure you are serving the app via `ng serve`.
